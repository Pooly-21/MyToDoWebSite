Creating a To-Do WebApp
 
Using  HTML, CSS and JavaScript you are going to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that helps your users keep track of various tasks.

• Add tasks to the list

• Delete tasks from the list

• Edit tasks

{ • Add due dates to tasks }

{ • Sort tasks alphabetically }

• Strike through tasks on the list

• Save tasks in their expected states and order even after the browser has been closed

• Extra - add name on top with save state. after pressing enter

 /*
 Think about what would make an app such as this useful for yourself and what will take your project above and beyond the brief within a realistic timeframe. If you don't find your own app particularly useful, chances are nor will it's users!
